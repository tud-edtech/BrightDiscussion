## Gamification Features

Students can earn badges by completing tasks within the system. There are badges on a global level and badges for each specific course. This way the badges can help participation in each new course.

## Justification of using gamification 

- Badges are increasingly being used in boundary systems including reward-oriented education scenarios
- Badges are visual representation of attainable goals and sub-goals
- Badges creates variable rewards for different aspects, hierarchies and purposes

## Badge types

### General badges

#### Type I: Tutorial (Beginner) badges  
Tutorial badges are rewarded when users actively explore functions of the system. It cultivates learners' habit and collect analytics on learner behavior.

- Create the first discussion thread
- Create the first reply/comment
- Shared the first external link
- Shared the first document

- Mentioned someone for the first time
- Rate the first discussion thread
- Rate the first reply/comment

#### Type II: Achievement (Master) badges  
Achievement badges are rewarded when learners accumulately accomplish tasks in the system, deemed valuable in education purpose or the activities of the community. It encourage learners to invest in the system and remind the users that they are on the right track.

- Created 100 discussions (continue with this at intervals, or getting more difficult)
- Created 100 replies
- Shared 20 external links
- Shared 10 Documents

### Course level badges

Course level badges can be achieved for each course. These badges focus on participation over actually being able to use the system.

#### Type III: Community badges  
The badge is distributed to content creators deemed credible by other learners.

- Create a discussion which is marked as helpful by 1 person
- Create a discussion which is marked as helpful by 5 people
- Create a discussion which is marked as helpful by 10 people

- Create a reply which is marked as helpful by 1 person
- Create a reply which is marked as helpful by 5 people

#### Type IV: Supervised badges  
Supervised badges are only distributed by supervision (e.g. lecturer, teaching assistant and more) to learners who contributed the discussion in a valuable manner. It helps to identify advanced learners and help validate the credibility of valuable threads, documents, links and explanations.

## Considerations
Some way of moderating is important to prevent spam or students trying to game the system to get badges.
- Word limit (minimum)
- User credit scores (e.g. based on badges, ratings)
- Pre-approved website domains for link/document screening
