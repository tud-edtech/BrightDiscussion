## Gamification Features

Students can earn badges by completing tasks within the system. There are badges on a global level and badges for each specific course. This way the badges can help participation in each new course.

## Justification of using gamification 

- Badges are increasingly being used in boundary systems including reward-oriented education scenarios
- Badges are visual representation of attainable goals and sub-goals
- Badges creates variable rewards for different aspects, hierarchies and purposes
